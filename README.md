# Project Management App

This app can be used to assign members of an organisation to different teams for different projects.

## Description

The Project Management App is a simple app created using React and React Router. The point of building this simple app was to practise and showcase my ability to build a React application using React Router, state and hooks.

## Usage

The app is simple to use.

1. Using the dropdown menu on the Home page, select the team you would like to fill with team members.
2. To fill your chosen team with members, simply click the members you would like to include in the team.
3. Once you have selected the relevant team members, simply repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining teams.

4. To view your teams, click "Teams" in the top navigation.
5. Each team can be clicked to view their team members.

6. To change the team members in a particular team, navigate to the Home page and select the team you wish to change using the drop down box.
7. Once you have selected the team you wish to change, simply select or deselect the members you wish to add or remove. Navigating back to "Teams" will refelect your changes.
